# Yandex Mail
The application for the desktop, inside which opens the web interface of Yandex mail.

## Why
I'm tired of opening a browser to read incoming mail, so I wrote an electron-wrapper over the web interface.

## Licence
I do not have the right to do this, so the project in closed gitlab and is not planned to be made public.
